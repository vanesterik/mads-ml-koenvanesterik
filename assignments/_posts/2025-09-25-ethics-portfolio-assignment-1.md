## Introduction

For the lectures of ethics, we are asked to research ethical models. This to get a better understanding of how to approach ethical dilemmas in the field of data science.

The terms used in the assignment description are defined as follows:

| Term            | Definition                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ethics          | Values held by society as a whole. (e.g. societal norms)                                                              |
| Ethical model   | A framework for making ethical decisions.                                                                             |
| Ethical dilemma | A situation in which two or more conflicting moral imperatives, none of which overrides the other, confront an agent. |
| Data Science    | The extraction or extrapolation of knowledge from structured or unstructured data.                                   |

These definitions will be used as the foundation for this assignment.

I will perform a relatively simple literature study in order to gain knowledge on this field and comply with the assignment. I will research multiple ethical models and compare them. In conclusion, I will explain which model I believe is most suited for data ethics.

## Method

The approach for this literature study are as follows:

- Research internationally since the field of ethics is globally relevant.
- Do not restrict the search to any timeframe as ethics is a long-standing field of study.
- Focus on peer-reviewed journals and conference papers to ensure the quality and credibility of the sources.
- Use keywords such as "ethical models", "ethical frameworks", "decision making", and "list of ethical models" to find relevant literature.
- Use boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine the search results.
- Use search engines and databases such as DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia and ScienceDirect to find relevant articles.
- Summarize and compare the models based on their key features, strengths, and weaknesses.

## Results

Initially, I found a comprehensive article (Status.net. (2023, August 15)) that outlined various ethical decision-making models (e.g. Kaplan University. (n.d.)). After reading this article and the references it provided, I was able to identify several other relevant sources (Potter Box. (2023), Oregon State University. (n.d.), Smith, J. (2024)).

Below a table summarizing and comparing four notable models:

| Model Name                                | Key Features                                                                                                          | Strengths                                                               | Weaknesses                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The PLUS Model                            | Focuses on Policies, Legal, Universal, and Self as filters for evaluating decisions.                                  | Encourages comprehensive analysis by considering multiple perspectives. | May be too broad and lack specific guidance for complex situations.        |
| The Character-Based Decision-Making Model | Applies the utilitarian approach, emphasizing the greatest good for the greatest number.                              | Promotes a clear and outcome-focused decision-making process.           | May overlook individual rights and minority perspectives.                  |
| The Potter Box                            | A four-step model that includes understanding facts, identifying values, applying principles, and choosing loyalties. | Provides a clear and structured approach to ethical decision-making.    | Results in varying decisions based on individual interpretations.          |
| The Seven-Step Guide                      | Integrates a flowchart approach to systematically analyze the ethical dimensions of a situation.                      | Provides a visual and intuitive way to navigate ethical decisions.      | May oversimplify complex ethical issues.                                   |
| The Ethical Decision-Making Algorithm     | Introduces a roadmap in order to develop ethical algorithms for decision-making.                                      | Provides a systematic approach to ethical decision-making by algorithms | May be too narrow in focus and not account for all ethical considerations. |

## Discussion

The fact that these models were so easy to find, leads me to believe that there are many more models out there. This was also eluded to by our lecturer.

With this in mind I would expect a model that is specifically designed for data ethics to exist, but I have not found one. The only exception to this statement is *The Ethical Decision-Making Algorithm*, which is not so much a model as it is a roadmap for developing ethical algorithms.

With more time I would have liked to explore more models and perhaps find one that is specifically designed for data ethics. However, I do believe that the models I have researched are relevant and applicable to the field of data science.

## Conclusion

After comparing the models, I find *The Potter Box* to be the most appealing. It provides a clear and structured approach to ethical decision-making, which is crucial in the complex field of data science. It aligns well with the various facets of ethical dilemmas in data science.

However, I do acknowledge that applying the model may lead to different decisions based on individual interpretations. But this could also be seen as a strength, as one could apply the model with multiple stakeholders to reach a consensus. I am Dutch - and the Dutch are known for their *'polder model'*, which is all about consensus and therefore logical and appealing for me to apply to ethical decision-making.
